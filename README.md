# Tech-Lab

A personal repository documenting my journey through various tech topics and projects. Each folder represents a new area of exploration, with code, notes, and examples to deepen my understanding and expand my skill set.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository is my experimental labâ€”a place to learn, practice, and collect code for everything from Docker to Data Science, Web Development, and beyond. As I learn new concepts, I add new folders to organize my work and make it easy to revisit topics later.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
The repository is organized by topics, with each topic in its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find:
- Code files and scripts
- Notes and documentation
- Small projects or exercises

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
Here are some of the topics currently in the lab:
  *New topics will be added as I continue learning.*
